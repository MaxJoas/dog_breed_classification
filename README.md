## Project Motivation

This project was created as part of my Udacity Data Scienc Nanodegree. The goal was to build a convolutional neural network to classify dog breeds. Since my past expierence had a focus on classical statistical/machine learning I was curious to work with artifical neural networks.

This project has two main parts:
1. A Notebook that documents my whole work process
2. A Web app, where users can upload images of their dogs and classify the breed! Try it out [here](https://dogbreedclassification.herokuapp.com)
