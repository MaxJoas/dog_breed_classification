## TL;DR
*  Built a CNN that classify dog breeds with an accurcay of 85%

## Project Motivation

This project was created as part of my Udacity Data Scienc Nanodegree. The goal was to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify dog breeds. Since my past expierence had a focus on classical statistical/machine learning I was curious to work with artifical neural networks.

This project has two main parts:
1. A Notebook that documents my whole work process
2. A Web app, where users can upload images of their dogs and classify the breed! Try it out [here](https://dogbreedclassification.herokuapp.com)

## Requirements
The required libraries can be found in `requirements.txt`

## File Structure
*  `dog_app.py` Script that loads data, builds, trains and save the CNN model
*  `dog_app.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook (partly filled by Udacity) that documents the working process of creating the CNN model
* `extract_bottleneck_features.py`
